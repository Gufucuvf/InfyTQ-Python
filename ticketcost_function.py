#Rate per Adult: Rs. 37550.0 
#Rate per Child: 1/3rd of the rate per adult 
#Service Tax: 7% of the ticket amount (including all passengers) 
#As it was a holiday season, the airline also offered 10% discount on the final ticket cost (after inclusion of the service tax).
#Find and display the total ticket cost for a group which had adults and children.
